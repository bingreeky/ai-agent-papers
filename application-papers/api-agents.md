## API Agents
* Enable users to operate specialized software via simple voice or text instructions
* Treat any software that supports REST APIs or Python SDKs as an agent‚Äôs tool
* Handle complex applications, including 3D modeling in manufacturing or chemistry
* Incorporate ‚ÄúAgentic Process Automation,‚Äù an evolution of RPA for routine workflows
