# AI Agents Papers
Updated biweekly.

## AI Agent
* AI agents are autonomous software entities that leverage intelligence technologies such as large language models and reinforcement learning to interact with their environment and pursue defined goals.

* They acquire and generate information through external APIs, sensors, and code execution capabilities, enabling context-aware decision-making and action selection.

* Through self-learning and feedback loops, they continuously improve their performance, minimizing human intervention while handling complex tasks.

* By supporting multimodal inputs and coordinating with other agents, they realize diverse cognitive functions such as dialogue, reasoning, and strategic planning.
