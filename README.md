# AI Agents Papers
Updated biweekly.

## AI Agents
* Intelligent systems leveraging (Multimodal)LLMs for multi-modal understanding, conversation, and reasoning
* Interact with digital or physical environments to achieve goals, using APIs or code
* ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù follows a lineage from symbolic representations to rule-based approaches, and now large-scale generative models
* Agents that rely on such large generative models are referred to here as GenAI Agents
